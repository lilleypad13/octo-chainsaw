Attach sound Burst to the Player object, add an audio source compenent and then attach the wav file to the appropriate 'source' spaces. 
"Sound Burst"  under the script, and 'AudioClip' under AudioSource. Im sure you know this, though.

As far as the background sound is concerned, Im pretty sure you can attach that to any object so long as Play on Awake and Loop are activated.
Personally I attached it to the camera with no problems.
